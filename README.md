How to Use This Modular System
This template implements a plugin system that allows you to add features without modifying the core HTML file. Here's how it works:

1. Plugin Structure
Each plugin is a JavaScript object with:

A name property

A render() method that returns HTML for the plugin

An optional init() method that sets up event listeners

2. Registering Plugins
To add a plugin, simply register it with the PluginSystem:

javascript
PluginSystem.register(YourPluginObject);
3. Example Plugins
I've included three sample plugins:

TodoPlugin: A simple task manager

NotesPlugin: A note-taking tool with localStorage persistence

WeatherPlugin: A weather display (would need API integration)

4. Adding Your Own Plugins
Create a new plugin object:

javascript
const YourPlugin = {
    name: 'Your Plugin Name',
    render: function() {
        return `
            <!-- Your HTML here -->
        `;
    },
    init: function(user) {
        // Your initialization code here
        // This is where you'd set up event listeners
    }
};

// Register your plugin
PluginSystem.register(YourPlugin);
5. Organizing Your Code
For better organization, you can:

Keep the main skeleton file as your base

Create separate JavaScript files for each plugin

Include them with <script> tags after the main code

6. Firebase Integration
The template includes Firebase authentication setup. Remember to:

Replace the Firebase config with your own

Implement the authentication functions (I've omitted them for brevity)

This modular approach lets you build your app like Lego blocks - adding and removing features as needed without touching the core template.# WebAppTPLMOD
